Ports Of Call - User Addons like ships, harbors and goods

The initial version contains collected ships, harbors and goods from several public sources like

http://www.zootierspocshipyard.de.vu/
http://www.stickymonk.co.uk/
http://www.pumospocship.de/
http://poc.bigbear.de/

Unfortunatelly I cannot exactly recall, which I got from where. 
Lots of them can be downloaded from several pages.

If one of these owners doesn't like me to offer his work here,
please kindly drop a note at the POC forum:

And now happy shipping ;)
